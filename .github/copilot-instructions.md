Always:
- Use null safety
- Follow clean architecture
- Prefer hydratedbloc for state management
- Analyze what the user wants as core consept before writing code
- Care always about user experience and developer experience, use best practices. Reference your ui-skill.md for frontend design guidelines.
- Based of user feedback at the end of the code generation based of your interactions with the user update if needed your preferences in the .github/preferences folder to improve future code generations.
- When you implement a feature check fir existing preferences that might be related to the feature you are implementing and skills that might be useful for the feature.
- If you havent done clearifing questions for a users new request, dont hesitate to ask the absolute needed questions to be able to deliver exactly what the user wants.

Note:
- All your skills are stored in .github/skills folder
- You can reference your skills in .github/skills folder to improve your quality of code generation when needed
- In the .github/preferences folder you have stored user preferences that you must always consider when generating code, the filenames that you create there should be consept specific for faster reference
